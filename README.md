## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”‚   # Next.js App router
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   # This folder is used to save Shadcn components
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui
â”‚   â”‚   # This is where I put projects and dictionary content
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ i18n

â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ es
â”‚   â”‚   # Types and utility functions

â”‚   # Static assets like images and fonts
â””â”€â”€ public
```

I decided to put all of my portfolio content in i18n/ folder because I wanted to build it in my mother language (Spanish) and English. I use some json files to define my projects content and also a dictionary file where I provide definitions for both languages.

## Source of Inspiration

- [Takuya's Portfolio](https://www.craftz.dog/).
- [Forrest's Portfolio](https://thehackershideout.com/).
- [Rose Pine Palette](https://rosepinetheme.com/).

As you may have noticed, this portfolio is highly inspired by Takuya's portfolio because I really liked it, and I also added some elements from Forrest's portfolio. Finally, the theme/colorscheme I chose is Rose Pine which I really enjoy and use in my code editor. I hope you like this portfolio. ðŸ™Œ
